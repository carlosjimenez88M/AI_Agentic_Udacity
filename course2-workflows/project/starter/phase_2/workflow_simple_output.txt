STEP 1: GENERATING USER STORIES
================================================================================
1. As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automatically classify incoming emails based on intent and urgency so that I can focus on addressing complex customer inquiries rather than spending time on email triage.
2. As an IT Administrator, I want the Email Router system to provide real-time performance metrics and response accuracy data through a comprehensive dashboard so that I can monitor system efficiency and make informed decisions for system optimization.
3. As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I want the Email Router system to intelligently route complex inquiries to me based on content analysis and predefined rules so that I can efficiently handle relevant and high-priority communications.
4. As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to generate contextually accurate responses for routine inquiries using the RAG system so that I can provide consistent messaging and information delivery to customers.
5. As an IT Administrator, I want the Email Router system to seamlessly integrate with existing email services via SMTP, IMAP, and RESTful APIs so that I can ensure smooth operation without disrupting current workflows.
6. As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I want the Email Router system to include manual override options for human intervention when necessary so that I can maintain control over critical communications that require personalized handling.
