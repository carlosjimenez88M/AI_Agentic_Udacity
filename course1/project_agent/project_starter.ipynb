    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

    "1. **Date Range**: Itinerary MUST span EXACTLY from arrival to departure dates (inclusive)\n",

    "3. **Activity Existence**: ONLY use activities from \"Available Activities\" list (NO hallucinations)\n",
    "4. **Activity Dates**: ONLY use activities available on the EXACT date being planned\n",
    "5. **Daily Minimum**: AT LEAST 1 activity per day (preferably 1-3 activities)\n",

    "- Note unique interests (need separate activities)\n",

    "STEP 1.2 - Weather Analysis:\n",
    "- Date | Condition | Suitable for outdoor?\n",
    "- Identify \"risky\" days (rain/storms)\n",
    "- Plan indoor-heavy itinerary for those days\n",

    "Priority 2 (P2): Activities matching one traveler's interests + weather-appropriate\n",
    "Priority 3 (P3): Unique experiences (festivals, special events)\n",
    "Priority 4 (P4): Filler activities to meet minimum daily requirement\n",

    "- Get activities available on THIS date\n",
    "- Remove if: outdoor-only AND weather is rainy\n",
    "- Remove if: cost would exceed remaining budget\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 3.2 - Select Activities:\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine if an activity is COMPATIBLE or INCOMPATIBLE with the weather condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INCOMPATIBLE scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Outdoor-only activities (hiking, beach, outdoor sports) during RAIN\n",
    "   - Activities explicitly requiring good weather during bad conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **COMPATIBLE scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Indoor activities (museums, theaters, cooking classes) in ANY weather\n",
    "   - Activities with indoor backup options mentioned in description\n",
    "   - Outdoor activities on sunny or cloudy (but not rainy) days\n",
    "   - When there's NOT enough information about weather sensitivity, assume IS_COMPATIBLE\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special cases**:\n",
    "   - If activity description mentions \"indoor alternative\" or \"rain plan\", it's COMPATIBLE\n",
    "   - Light rain vs heavy rain: Use judgment based on activity description\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: When in doubt or when information is insufficient, default to IS_COMPATIBLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output format\n",
    "\n",
    "    REASONING:\n",
    "    * Weather condition: [state the weather]\n",
    "    * Activity type: [indoor/outdoor/mixed]\n",
    "    * Weather sensitivity: [high/medium/low]\n",
    "    * Key factors: [list relevant factors from description]\n",
    "    * Decision rationale: [explain your reasoning]\n",
    "\n",
    "    FINAL ANSWER:\n",
    "    [IS_COMPATIBLE or IS_INCOMPATIBLE]\n",

    "## Operational Phases (Follow in STRICT ORDER)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: DIAGNOSIS (Iterations 1-2)\n",
    "**Goal**: Understand ALL problems before attempting fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Actions**:\n",
    "1. Call `run_evals_tool` with current plan → Get comprehensive failure list\n",
    "2. Categorize failures by type:\n",
    "   - Type A: Missing/incorrect data (dates, activities)\n",
    "   - Type B: Constraint violations (budget, weather)\n",
    "   - Type C: Feedback not incorporated (traveler requests)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: Failure inventory with root causes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: DATA GATHERING (Iterations 3-5)\n",
    "**Goal**: Collect information needed for fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Selection Decision Tree**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF (weather incompatibility detected):\n",
    "    → get_activities_by_date_tool for affected dates\n",
    "    → Filter for indoor activities\n",
    "\n",
    "IF (budget exceeded):\n",
    "    → calculator_tool to verify math\n",
    "    → Identify most expensive activities\n",
    "    → Find cheaper alternatives via get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "\n",
    "IF (interest not matched):\n",
    "    → Review available activities via get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "    → Filter by interest categories\n",
    "\n",
    "IF (feedback: \"X activities per day\"):\n",
    "    → Calculate current activities per day\n",
    "    → Identify days below threshold\n",
    "    → get_activities_by_date_tool for those days\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: FIX APPLICATION (Iterations 6-12)\n",
    "**Goal**: Apply fixes based on gathered data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix Priority Order**:\n",
    "1. P0 (Blocker): Date mismatches, non-existent activities\n",
    "2. P1 (Critical): Budget violations, weather incompatibility\n",
    "3. P2 (High): Interest coverage, feedback incorporation\n",
    "4. P3 (Medium): Activity distribution, time optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Strategy**:\n",
    "- Fix one category at a time (don't mix)\n",
    "- Verify each fix doesn't break other constraints\n",
    "- Use calculator_tool for ANY arithmetic (costs, counts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: VERIFICATION (Iteration 13-14)\n",
    "**Goal**: Confirm ALL criteria pass before final submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Actions**:\n",
    "1. Call `run_evals_tool` on revised plan\n",
    "2. IF `success: false` → Return to Phase 3 (max 2 additional cycles)\n",
    "3. IF `success: true` → Proceed to Phase 5\n",

    "## Tool Catalog & Usage Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. calculator_tool\n",

    "**Anti-patterns (DON'T)**:\n",
    "- Manual arithmetic in THOUGHT (always use tool)\n",
    "- Complex nested expressions (break into steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "- Need to see ALL activities for a specific date\n",
    "- Searching for alternative activities\n",
    "- Verifying activity availability\n",

    "- Calling for dates outside trip range\n",
    "- Assuming activity availability without checking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. run_evals_tool\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "- Beginning of cycle (Phase 1)\n",
    "- After applying fixes (Phase 4)\n",
    "- MANDATORY before final_answer_tool\n",

    "- Calling with partial/incomplete plans\n",
    "- Skipping before final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. final_answer_tool\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",

    "- ALL feedback incorporated\n",
    "- Phase 5 reached\n",

    "## Error Recovery Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Type 1: Invalid JSON in ACTION**\n",
    "→ Review JSON syntax rules\n",
    "→ Ensure all strings use double quotes\n",
    "→ Check for missing commas, braces\n",
    "→ Retry with corrected JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Type 2: Tool execution error**\n",
    "→ Review tool docstring for correct parameters\n",
    "→ Verify parameter types (string vs int vs dict)\n",
    "→ Check parameter values are valid (dates in range, etc.)\n",
    "→ Retry with corrected parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Type 3: Evaluation still failing after fixes**\n",
    "→ Re-read the EXACT failure message\n",
    "→ Verify fix was actually applied to plan\n",
    "→ Check if fix broke another constraint\n",
    "→ Try alternative approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Type 4: Approaching iteration limit (12+)**\n",
    "→ Identify which failure is hardest to fix\n",
    "→ Focus ONLY on that one issue\n",
    "→ Use simpler solution (remove rather than replace)\n",
    "→ Prioritize getting to `success: true` over perfect plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Detection & Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "**System will auto-detect**:\n",
    "- Same tool called 3+ times with identical arguments\n",
    "- No progress on failure count after 3 iterations\n",
    "- Cost/date/count unchanged after \"fix\" applied\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your responsibility**:\n",
    "- Track in THOUGHT what you tried before\n",
    "- If stuck, try DIFFERENT approach (different tool or different parameters)\n",
    "- If truly stuck after 3 attempts, simplify solution (remove problematic activities)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mandatory Traveler Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Feedback**: \"{TRAVELER_FEEDBACK}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Requirements**:\n",
    "- Parse feedback to extract specific requirement (e.g., \"at least 2 activities per day\")\n",
    "- Create verifiable criterion (count activities per day, ensure all ≥ 2)\n",
    "- Add activities if needed using get_activities_by_date_tool\n",
    "- MUST pass eval_traveler_feedback_is_incorporated before finalizing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria (ALL must be TRUE)\n",

The activities selected reflect the travelers' diverse interests and take into account the weather conditions expected during your stay.\n",

The day offers a delightful blend of tennis and culinary experiences with \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon,\" an event that combines a friendly outdoor tennis game followed by a hands-on cooking workshop. This event will especially appeal to Yuri’s interests in tennis and cooking while enjoying the beautiful weather. Later in the evening, there is an indoor literary and artistic gathering called the \"AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape\" at The Ink Loft, which is ideal for Hiro. This cozy event invites participants to engage in writing games, group prompts, and sharing their stories in a comfortable setting, aligning well with his love for reading and art.\n",

       "June 12 brings thunderstorms, so the itinerary wisely includes weather-resistant activities. Around midday, the \"Soundtrack Picnic: Lunchtime Movies & Melodies\" invites you to enjoy classic movie scenes with live music. While it is an outdoor event, it has a rain-safe plan to move indoors if needed, ensuring comfort despite the weather. In the evening, the \"Tech & Film Fusion Night\" showcases a special screening of sci-fi short films and an interactive panel on technology's impact on cinema.
